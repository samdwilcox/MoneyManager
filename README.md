MoneyManager is a basic finance manager app, allowing the user to enter expenses/incomes and to calculate their income tax from their annual salary.

Transactions can be added in the 'Add income/expense' page.
Transactions are saved to the database allowing them to be viewed again on each login.
Details of transactions and a note can be viewed on the dashboard in the transaction history table.

Tax is automatically calculated when user inputs salary in the 'Enter salary' page.
